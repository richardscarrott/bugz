# Bugz

Composable User Agent Detection.

## TODO
- [ ] Throw if `UA` is not passed in to `parse` as `ua-parser-js` fallsback to `window.navigator.userAgent` in a browser env.
- [ ] Document with examples.
- [ ] Add helper functions for popular browsers / engines and operating systems.
- [ ] Add integration tests to test composability.
- [ ] Hook up to Travis and Coveralls.
- [ ] Publish.
